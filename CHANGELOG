Version change log.

=next=
A simple ECMAScript quasi-quoter.

=0.10=

The ParenExpr constructor was removed from the Expression AST
(WARNING: might break some builds). The pretty printer was rewritten
to automatically parenthesize sub-expressions based on operator
precedence. Added a (beta quality) arbitrary instance for all the
AST's to generate random JavaScript programs (useful for testing).


=0.9.1= 
Increased the upper bound on data-default in dependencies. See
https://github.com/jswebtools/language-ecmascript/pull/5
